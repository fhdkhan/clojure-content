# Clojure files and Scripts
The `clojure` command will take a file name as an argument, evaluated all the Clojure code in that file and return the result.  A file is useful for simple Clojure scripts and batch processing jobs.

```
clojure script.clj
```

> #### Hint::Babashka - scripting with Clojure
> [Babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) is a alternative to Bash scripting, using the Clojure language for scripts.  Babashka is native compiled using [GraalVM's native image builder](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/) so is very fast.
