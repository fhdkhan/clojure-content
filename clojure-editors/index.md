# Editors for Clojure development
The best editor to use for learning Clojure is the editor you are already familiar with (or want to learn).  Ideally this will be an editor that supports clojure by providing:

* syntax highlighting (colored parens can be useful too)
* structural editing to ensure parens are balanced when writing and refactor code
* running / connecting to a REPL process
* evaluation results inline or in a repl window (fast feedback on what the code does)
* data inspector / browser to visualise large and nested data ([external tools available](/clojure-tools/data-browsers/))

![Clojure REPL driven development with Clojure aware editors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jr0cket/developer-guides/master/clojure/clojure-repl-driven-development-clojure-aware-editor.png)

Emacs (Spacemacs), VSCode, Atom, Vim and IntelliJ are the most common Editors for Clojure and ClojureScript development. **[Install guides](editor-install-guides)** are provided for these editors.

<!-- Spacemacs -->
{% content "spacemacs" %}
[Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org/) is a community configuration bringing [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) together.  Spacemacs uses a mnemonic menu system that makes it easy to learn.

[Spacemacs, Practicalli](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs) guides you through Clojure development, documenting with org-mode, Git version control with Magit, Vim editing modes and dozens of other features.

Neovim is a hyperextensible Vim-based text editor that is a drop-in replacement of Vim, implemented in less coded, fully compatible with Vim"s editing model and Vimscript extension language.  Neovim also allows configuration in Lua.

[Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) is an interactive environment for evaluating code within your running program, initially targeted at Lisp languages such as Clojure.

* [Practicalli install guide for neovim and conjure](./editor-install-guides/neovim-conjure.md)
* [Practicalli user guide for neovim and conjure](./editor-user-guides/neovim-conjure.md)


#### Quick try tutorial
Try the Conjure interactive `:ConjureSchool` tutorial without the need to install, only a recent version of neovim
```shell
curl -fL conjure.fun/school | sh
```

<!-- VSpaceCode and Calva -->

{% content "vspacecode"%}

[VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode) is a Spacemacs-like community configuration for Microsoft VS Code. Drive VS Code and Calva entirely from the keyboard, using easy to remember mnemonic keys for all commands and full vim-stile editing tools.

Also included edamagit, a sophisticated text based Git client (like magit for Emacs).

> Currently there is a [pull request to add Clojure mode key bindings](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode/pull/154) that call Calva functions

<!-- Atom.io -->
{% content "atom" %}

[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) is flexible and simple to use editor.  [Chlorine](https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine) is the recommended plugin for Atom.io. [ProtoREPL](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl) is not actively maintained at present. The [Chlorine plugin for Atom](https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine) is especially recommended for ClojureScript shadow-cljs projects.

#### Chlorine

![Atom.io and ProtoREPL](/images/atom-protorepl-demo.gif)


#### Proton - alternative menu and configuration approach
Proton offers a simple mnemonic menu as an alternative to the multiple keys for shortcuts in Atom.io.  Proton also gives you a simple text configuration to manage all your packages quickly.  Unfortunately Proton is not complete replacement of all actions.

<!-- VSCode and Calva -->
{% content "vscode" %}
The Calva extension adds Clojure support to Microsoft VS Code editor.

> #### Danger::Calva required high memory at times
> Recommend using Calva version 2.0.136 unless several Gigabytes of free memory is available on your computer. A specific version can be selected via *Extensions > Install Another Version...*
>
> Calva has added clojure-lsp to provide refactoring features.  Since version 2.0.137 Calva will run a memory intensive process when a project is open.  Ensure you have several Gb of memory available to avoid issues.  Maintainers are actively working on this issue to make Calva more efficient.  The maintainers will not be providing a mechanism to disable LSP.


Calva is an active project and the [#calva channel on the Clojurians Slack community](clojurians.slack.com/messages/calva) is very supportive.  New versions may break, so its advisable to only upgrade to new versions when there is time to resolve potential issues.

<!-- IntelliJ and Cursive -->
{% content "intellij" %}
Developers from a Java background are usually familiar with IDE"s such as IntelliJ, so [Cursive IDE for IntelliJ](https://cursive-ide.com/) may be an appropriate choice.  Cursive uses the static analysis of Clojure code as well as a REPL.

> #### Hint::Requires license for commercial development
> There is a free license when development is not for commercial projects, however, a license must be purchased for each developer working on a commercial project.
